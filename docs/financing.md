# Financing F*ckDebt

## Philosophy
F*ckDebt is about financial freedom, not adding burdens. No monthly fees or subscriptions—ever. Inspired by *Manage Your Money Like a F*cking Grownup*, I’m keeping it free, secure, and funding it through voluntary support.

## How It Works
I’m using [BuyMeACoffee](https://buymeacoffee.com/yourusername) for one-time donations. Users can tip if they want to, when they can—no pressure, no guilt.

### Why BuyMeACoffee?
- **No Debt Trap**: One-off contributions won’t mess with your budget.
- **Community Support**: It’s like buying a mate a coffee for helping you out.
- **Fits the Mission**: Helps me build tools—offline-ready and private—to get you out of debt, not into it.

### In-App Integration
- **Prompt**: “Love this app? Buy me a coffee to keep it rolling!” with a button linking to BMC.
- **Milestones**: After a win (e.g., “Debt #1 gone!”), a pop-up says: “Hell yeah! Fuel this app with a coffee?”
- **Transparency**: A “Why Support?” note explains: “No fees here—your coffee keeps F*ckDebt free, secure, and available offline for everyone.”

### Goal
Every coffee helps me cover hosting, development time, and maybe a real coffee to keep coding. It’s all about mutual empowerment—your support fuels a tool that sets you free.
