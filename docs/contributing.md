# Contributing to F*ckDebt

## How to Contribute
F*ckDebt is a solo mission to help you kill debt, but I’m open to your ideas and feedback. Here’s how you can pitch in:

- **Issues**: Spot a bug or have a feature idea? Post it on [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/yourusername/fckdebt/issues).
- **Suggestions**: Want to suggest something bigger? Email me at [your-email@example.com](mailto:your-email@example.com).
- **Pull Requests**: Sorry, not accepting PRs—I’m keeping this tight and focused, so I won’t be reviewing them.

## What I’m Looking For
- Bug reports with steps to reproduce.
- Feature ideas that fit the “no-BS, debt-crushing” vibe.
- Feedback on usability or security (it’s gotta stay bulletproof).

## Process
1. Post your issue or shoot me an email.
2. I’ll review when I can—coding this between real life, so patience appreciated.
3. If it fits, I’ll add it to the [roadmap](/docs/roadmap.md).

## No Code? No Problem
You don’t need to code to help—just tell me what sucks or what’d make F*ckDebt even better.
