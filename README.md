# F*ckDebt: Personal Finance & Debt Management

## Overview
F*ckDebt is a cross-platform mobile app inspired by *Manage Your Money Like a F*cking Grownup* by Sam Beckbessinger. It’s here to help you kick debt’s ass, build a f*ck-off fund, and take control of your money—without the bullshit. Built with Flutter, Node.js/Express, and PostgreSQL, it’s secure, offline-capable, and actually useful.

### Inspiration
Based on the book’s no-nonsense advice:
- Crush debt with smart strategies.
- Budget like a grownup (50/20/30 rule).
- Save for emergencies and freedom.

### Features
- **Debt Repayment**: Track debts, toggle snowball/avalanche (offline), see your progress.
- **Money Dashboard**: Net worth, accounts, and goals (like your F*ck-Off Fund).
- **Budgeting**: 50/20/30 or custom setup, works offline.
- **Offline Calculators**: Debt payoff, savings, freedom number—no internet needed.
- **Motivation**: Celebrate wins with notifications and BuyMeACoffee prompts.
- **Security**: Your data’s encrypted with an AES-256 key you control—we can’t see it.
- **Web Login**: Future browser access via mobile push approval.

## Tech Stack
- **Frontend**: Flutter (Dart)
- **Backend**: Node.js/Express
- **Database**: PostgreSQL
