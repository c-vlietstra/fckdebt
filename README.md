# F*ckDebt: Personal Finance & Debt Management

## Overview
MoneyApp is a cross-platform mobile app inspired by Sam Beckbessinger’s *Manage Your Money Like a F*cking Grownup*. It’s here to help you kick debt’s ass, build a f*ck-off fund, and take control of your money—without the bullshit. Built with Flutter, Node.js/Express, and PostgreSQL, it’s simple, bold, and actually useful.

### Inspiration
Based on the book’s no-nonsense advice:
- Crush debt with smart strategies.
- Budget like a grownup (50/20/30 rule).
- Save for emergencies and freedom.

### Features
- **Debt Repayment**: Track debts, toggle snowball/avalanche, see your progress.
- **Money Dashboard**: Net worth, spending, and goals (like your F*ck-Off Fund).
- **Budgeting**: 50/20/30 setup to keep it real.
- **Calculators**: Debt payoff, savings, and your “freedom number.”
- **Motivation**: Celebrate wins like “First $1,000 down!”
